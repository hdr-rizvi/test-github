# Modifications
## Step 1
### Modification from desktop
> this is fist attempt - 1
> this is fist attempt - 2
> this is fist attempt - 3

> Test attempt 4

> Test attempt 5, seting branch-1


## Steps-1
once i tested to make a branch baranch-1, it worked 

> i also tested to commit baranch-1

> i also tested to create a pull request
    > and merging baranch-1 to main and it also worked

## Step-2 
Now i am repeating step-1 for reconfirmation and practice

> (i). first i am going to save in baranch-1 i.e., commiting to baranch-1 without doing any thing to main baranch (untii i mentioned)


> (ii). In step 2(i), i update readme file in baranch-1 without updating main baranch, by (a) commiting  (b) pusing. It WORKED. In this step I am again commiting the baranch-1 and by commiting it and pusing it. BUT THIS TIME USING VS CODE

> (iii). Step(ii) worked well I commited and pushes from the VS CODE, it worked best. Now repeating again through git desktop. Also note just commiting doesnot update web-version unless pushes.

## step 3

> (i). Upto this step master baranch is updated upto step 1, however branch-1 on github.com is updated upto step2(iii). 

> (ii). Now we will finally have two tests that remains
    > (a). copy baranch-1 to baranch-2 
    > (b). update master baranch from baranch-1 or baranch-2
